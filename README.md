# Road Blocks 

Throughout this assignment, we encountered roadblocks that have become somewhat familiar this semester. Primarily, this was in the form of time constraints imposed by assignments from other classes and other commitments associated with Thanksgiving Break. As for the assignment itself, there was a large scope of requisite background material to know how to get started working, so much time was spent studying/reviewing the context of the assignment. Additionally, the new RESTful Flask tooling took time to become familiar with.
